# -Age-calculator 
An age calculator is a tool or program designed to determine a person's age or the duration between two dates, typically measured in years, months, and days. Age calculators are commonly used in various applications such as form validation, birthday reminders, and legal compliance systems.

Purpose of an Age Calculator
Personal Use: To quickly calculate someone's age from their birthdate.
Professional Use: For systems requiring age verification (e.g., employment eligibility, voting, insurance, or licensing applications).
Time Calculations: To find the exact time elapsed between two events for historical, legal, or scientific purposes.

How It Works
Input:
User enters a birthdate and (optionally) the target date (default is the current date).
Processing:
The calculator determines the difference between the two dates.
Modern systems use precise algorithms or libraries to handle complexities like leap years and varying month lengths.
Output:
The result is displayed as the age in years, months, and/or days.

Implementation
Programming Languages: Age calculators can be implemented in various programming languages (e.g., Java, Python, JavaScript).
